Crezco is an organization that originated from a small church ministry that began with a short-term mission trip in 1996 to a Christian children's home in Honduras.

GROWTH THROUGH KNOWLEDGE
Over time, a strong relationship developed between the church and the children's home, leading to the realization that recent high school graduates from the home needed support to pursue higher education.

The goal was to equip students with the education and skills necessary to break the cycles of poverty, lack of education, unhealthy family patterns, mental health challenges, and the very circumstances that led them to the home. The ministry also aimed to instill in students a passion for serving others in Jesus.

GROWTH THROUGH INFLUENCE
As the ministry continued to expand, the decision was made to establish Crezco as a formal organization. In addition to the university program, Crezco's work also includes ongoing support for the local community.

This support ranges from addressing emergency situations and providing medical care resources, to coordinating donations of clothing and educational supplies, organizing special celebrations, and disaster relief efforts.

GROWTH THROUGH EMPOWERMENT
Funding for these efforts come from donors like you. Donations cover academic, medical, and personal expenses for each student. To date, 26 young people have benefited from the university program, with 15* successfully graduating from Christian universities throughout Latin America.

Graduates have obtained degrees in diverse fields including computer systems engineering, culinary arts, physical therapy, nursing, clinical psychology, and graphic design. Each year new students from the children's home begin their university studies.
