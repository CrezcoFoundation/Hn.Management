      Crezco is an organization that originated from a small church ministry
      based in the United States. This ministry began in 1996 with short-term
      mission trips to a Christian children's home in Honduras, Central America.
    </p>
    <p class="text-center description-project">
      Over the years, a strong relationship developed between the church and the
      children's home, leading to a realization that recent high school
      graduates from the home needed support to pursue higher education.

        <p>
          With the help of local church members, community members, donations,
          and sponsorships, the ministry worked to make the dream of a
          university education a reality for these young adults. The overarching
          goal was to equip these students with the education and skills
          necessary to break the cycles of poverty, lack of education, unhealthy
          family patterns, mental health challenges, and the circumstances that
          led them to the children's home in the first place. Additionally, the
          ministry aimed to instill a passion for serving others in the name of
          Jesus in these young adults

      Funding for these efforts has always come from donations provided by
      individuals in various communities. These donations cover university
      costs, fees, transportation, and essential personal items for each
      student. Over the years, 26 young people have benefited from the
      university education aspect of the ministry, with 15 successfully
      graduating from Christian universities in countries such as Costa Rica,
      Mexico, and Peru.
    </p>
    <p class="text-center description-project">
      These graduates have obtained degrees in diverse fields, including
      computer systems engineering, culinary arts, physical therapy, nursing,
      clinical psychology, and graphic design. Currently, there are students
      studying in Peru and Mexico, and new students from the children's home
      begin their university studies each year.

          As the ministry continued to expand its influence beyond its initial
          purpose, the decision was made to establish Crezco as a formal
          organization. In addition to the university program, Crezco's work
          also includes ongoing support for the children's home and the local
          community. This support ranges from addressing emergency situations
          and providing medical care resources to coordinating donations of
          clothing and educational supplies, organizing special celebrations,
          and participating in disaster relief efforts. The collaboration
          between Crezco and the small community in Honduras has grown far
          beyond what we ever imagined.
